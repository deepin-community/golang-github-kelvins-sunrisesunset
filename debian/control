Description: Go package that provides the sunrise and sunset equation. (library)
 This package is used to calculate the apparent sunrise and sunset times based
 on latitude, longitude, date and UTC offset. It was created based on the
 Corrected Sunrise, Sunset, Noon Times in Seconds - and Solar Angles Matlab
 function developed by Richard Droste, that was created based on the
 spreadsheets available in the Earth System Research Laboratory website
 from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
